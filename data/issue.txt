:::::::::::::: Current Issue with reasoning in sft data :::::::::::::::
*** BIG DATA IS FOR RESULTS ** SMAll data is for understanding ***


But we are leaning now it is acceptable
Issue 1: Redundant / Degenerate Reasoning Steps
Step 1: Add 13 and 45
Step 2: 13 + 45 = 58
It is logically correct, but Step 1 adds no information.

Issue 2: Some Trivial Decompositions
Decompose 40 into 40 and 0
This is mathematically fine, but:
Adds noise
Teaches unnecessary patterns

Issue 3: Dataset Homogeneity
All reasoning follows one pattern.
